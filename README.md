# DeepScroll
The toolkit allows iOS developers to create content views that recognize input from three vertical scroll lanes and dynamically resize themselves based on a tagging system that is associated with the scroll lane input. This results in an interaction technique that allows the user to sift through content more efficiently and reduce the total amount of time they spend scrolling.
